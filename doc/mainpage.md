	\par
	Embedis is a library for creating embedded dictionary servers. \n
        Embedis is used for embedding key-value dictionaries into the \n
        Flash, FRAM, NVSRAM, EEPROM, and SDcard memory systems of small embedded computing platforms.\n

	\section	main_background Background
	\par
	We found ourselves repeating a lot of work developing simple persistant storage libraries 
        across a number of different projects and platforms. \n
        Embedis was developed to provide a very simple interface for storing and retrieving data
        from pins, sensors, interfaces, and other I/O devices, in simple and efficient way. \n
