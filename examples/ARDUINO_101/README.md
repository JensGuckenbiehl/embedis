# Embedis - Embedded Dictionary Server

## Examples for Arduino101

Just starting support for the Arduino101 platform.
It compiles and executes, however the CurieEEPROM emulation in Flash,
doesn't appear to be "writing" data correctly yet - not sure where the problem lies...
I'll work on it when I have time.
The rest of the Embedis system is working, just not CurieEEPROM...
