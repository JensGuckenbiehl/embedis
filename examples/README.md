# Embedis - Embedded Dictionary Server [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thingSoC/embedis.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thingSoC/embedis)

## Examples for Different Boards

The Arduino IDE now has he capability to support many different CPU architectures and boards.
The generic Embedis example uses the builtin EEPROM of the AVR/ATMEGA family, and
will run on boards like the Uno, Leonardo, Mega, and their variations.

If you have a different board (and/or CPU architecture) you will need to use one of the examples specifically for that board.
